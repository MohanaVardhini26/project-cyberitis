Cyber Security for Big Data and IoT using Machine Learning
Project Cyberitis - Automated Cyber Security System designed for Big Data Environments, Offline IoT Devices, and Complex Data Analytics 

Next-generation Cyber Security System using Machine Learning, Automation, and Big Data Analytic stacks. 

Project Cyberitis Big Data components consists of Hadoop, Spark and Storm based tools for outlier and anomaly detection, which are interweaved into the system's machine learning and automation engine for real-time fraud detection to forensics, intrusion detection to forensics.

The Cyber Security System incorporates Lumify, an open source big data analysis and visualization platform to provide big data analysis and visualization of each instances of fraud or intrusion events into temporary, compartmentalized virtual machines that creates a full snapshot of the network infrastructure and infected device to allow an in-depth analytics, forensic review, and provide a transportable threat analysis for Executive level next-steps. 

Cyberitis uses local and cloud resources to launch Lumify for big data analysis and visulalization (customizable per environment and user). Open Source Lumify Dev Virtual Machine includes only the backend servers (Hadoop, Accumulo, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Zookeeper) used for development. This VM makes it easy for developers to get started without needing to install the full stack on thier develoment machines. 

Big Data Analytics and Cyber Security Reports:

	•	Simple to use
	•	Input output in CSV format
	•	Metadata defined in simple JSON file
	•	Extremely configurable with tons of configuration knobs


Project Cyberities Additional Has Manual Tools For Big Data Analytics And Forensics:
	•	Fast and flexible synthetic machine learning data generator with high degree veracity
	•	Intrusion detection representative workloads
	•	A user-friendly interface to monitor the cluster performance, showing application and 	system metrics

ARCHITECTURE

The System Is Composed Of Four Main Components:

  1 Machine Learning Dataset Generator
  2 Global And Self-Generating Local Representative Workloads
  3 Machine Learning Metrics Of Interest And Visualization
  4 Backend (Local And Cloud Deployable) Big Data Analysis And Visualization Platform
